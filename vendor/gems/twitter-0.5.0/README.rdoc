= twitter

The ruby twitter gem. The gem heard round the world and famous on the streets. Haha.

For now this is just an API wrapper. The command line interface is temporarily dead until I have time to make it work with oauth. At that point, I'll make it a new gem twitter-cli or something and it will depend on this gem to work. That will keep the separation of the api wrapper and cli and fix a lot of dependency issues.
